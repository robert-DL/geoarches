# Contribute to geoarches
## Setup

To contribute to `geoarches`, we recommend working from your own fork of the repository.

### 0. First follow [installation](../getting_started/installation.md#install-from-source) instructions to install from source.
This will install the code in editable mode, so any changes you make will be immediately reflected in your project.
Your working directory should look like this:

```
├── geoarches/       # Cloned repo
│   ├── geoarches/
│   ├── ...
└── my_project/      # Your own scripts, notebooks, experiments...
    ├── ...
```

### 1. Fork and clone

First, [fork the official repo](https://github.com/INRIA/geoarches) to your own GitHub account.

Then clone your fork locally:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/geoarches.git
```

Next, add the original (upstream) repository as a remote, so you can pull updates from the main repo:

```sh
cd geoarches
git remote add upstream git@github.com:INRIA/geoarches.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Follow the [installation instructions](../getting_started/installation.md) to set up your environment and install required packages.

### 3. Work from a development branch

Before making changes, create a development branch off of `main`. For example:

```sh
git checkout main
git pull upstream main  # Just in case
git checkout -b dev_<your_name_or_feature>
```

You can now safely make changes on your fork. This avoids interfering with the main `geoarches` development, and keeps your work isolated until it's ready to contribute.

This setup also ensures you can:

- Contribute new code via pull requests (see [Code reviews](#code-reviews))
- Sync easily with updates from upstream (see [Pull code updates](#pull-code-updates))

## Local testing

All new code must be covered by tests under the `tests/` directory. To run tests:

```sh
pytest tests/
```

## Code formatting

We recommend reading [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) for tips of writing readable code.

Before committing, run:

```sh
ruff check --fix
ruff format
codespell -w
```

### Optional: Pre-commit hooks

You can run these checks automatically before each commit using [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/). Run the following command in the root of your cloned repository to set it up:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

!!! success "Now, these tools will run automatically on `git commit`!"

## Code reviews

Once your code is ready and pushed to a branch, you can prepare it to be reviewed and merged into the main `geoarches` codebase.

You have two options:

- Use your current local branch directly (make sure it's up to date with `upstream/main`, see [Pull code updates](#pull-code-updates)),
- Or create a clean branch based on `upstream/main` and apply just your relevant commits on top of it.

To create a clean branch from `upstream/main`:

```sh
# Make sure your local copy of upstream is up to date
git fetch upstream main

# Create a new branch based on upstream/main
git checkout -b <feature_branch_name> -t upstream/main
```

Then use `git cherry-pick` to apply a specific range of commits (from commit A to B):

```sh
git cherry-pick A^..B
```

This allows you to transfer only the changes you want, without dragging along unrelated commit history.

---

To check that your code passes tests before submitting a PR, push the branch to **your fork** (not upstream yet):

```sh
git push origin <feature_branch_name>
```

Then open a **fake pull request on your own fork**. This triggers GitHub Actions and runs the test suite, just like it would on a real PR to geoarches.

---

Once you're confident everything works and tests pass, push the clean feature branch to the upstream repository:

```sh
git push upstream <feature_branch_name>
```

Then open a new [pull request](https://github.com/INRIA/geoarches/pulls) on GitHub which will target the `main` branch of geoarches. It will only be eligible to merge once:

- All CI tests pass
- You’ve received approval from a project maintainer

## Pull code updates

When the `main` branch of `geoarches` gets updated and you want to bring those changes into your branch, follow these steps. This is important for:

- Taking advantage of the latest code
- Avoiding merge conflicts before opening a PR

If you haven’t yet, set up a remote that tracks the upstream repo. You can check your remotes with:

```sh
git remote -v
```

If needed, add the upstream remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:INRIA/geoarches.git
```

### 1. Stash or commit your changes

If you have uncommitted work on your branch, stash it:

```sh
git stash push -m "WIP before syncing"
```

Or commit it normally.

### 2. Fetch upstream changes

Update your local references to the upstream repo:

```sh
git fetch upstream main
```

### 3. Checkout your development branch

Switch to the branch you want to sync (e.g. your dev branch):

```sh
git checkout dev_<your_name>
```

Then apply upstream changes. Use `rebase` if you're the only one working on this branch (recommended). Use `merge` if others are working on it too.

```sh
git rebase upstream/main
# or
git merge upstream/main
```

If there are conflicts, Git will pause and ask you to resolve them. Once resolved:

```sh
git rebase --continue
# or
git merge --continue
```

If you want to cancel everything and undo:

```sh
git rebase --abort
# or
git merge --abort
```

### 4. Apply stashed changes (if any)

If you stashed your work earlier, re-apply it now:

```sh
git stash pop
```

If there are conflicts during stash pop, resolve them. If you want to undo the stash application:

```sh
git reset --merge
```

This will cancel the stash apply, but keep the stash saved so you can re-apply it later if needed.
